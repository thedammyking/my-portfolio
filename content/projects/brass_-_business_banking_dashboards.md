title: Brass - Business Banking Dashboards
year: "2020"
made_at: Brass
summary: These include the onboarding, business and employee dashboards. I built
  some of the features and collaborated with other engineers to update, build
  and fix features. I ensured code quality and adherence to conventions, as well
  as optimization, scaling and upgrading the codebase.
