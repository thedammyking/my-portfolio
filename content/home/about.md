title: About
---
I began my coding journey in 2013, initially writing shell scripts and handling terminal prompts in Linux OS to address booting issues. This early experience sparked my interest in software development, leading me to learn HTML, CSS, and PHP. I further developed these skills through an internship at Cregital and continued to grow professionally at several innovative companies.

Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to master new technologies and lead teams in building scalable, user-friendly, and high-performing frontend applications that positively impact users and support business goals.
