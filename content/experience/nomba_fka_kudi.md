I was instrumental in creating a version of the company's website and worked with other developers to maintain it. My role extended to implementing, optimizing, and maintaining web solutions for different teams, ensuring they were efficient, scalable, and aligned with business objectives.
I developed and maintained a React component library with other engineers, which streamlined our development process and guaranteed consistency in style and functionality across our solutions. Additionally, I collaborated with the team to design and implement various web solutions, focusing on meeting requirements and achieving efficient, high-quality outcomes.
