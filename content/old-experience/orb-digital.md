At Orb Digital, my role centered on building websites to help businesses and services expand their reach and grow. I worked with a diverse range of clients, including HR Flex, Jollof Republik, and Babelos, creating custom web solutions tailored to their needs. Additionally, I contributed to Mallbly, an online store, enhancing its e-commerce capabilities and user experience.
