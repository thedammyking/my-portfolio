At Nomba, I was instrumental in building and maintaining web-based solutions. I created and managed a version of the company's website and supported other developers. I also implemented, optimized, and maintained web solutions across teams, ensuring efficiency and scalability. A highlight was building a React component library, which improved our development process by providing consistent style and functionality. I worked with the team to design and implement various web solutions, always focused on meeting requirements and delivering high-quality results. My role at Nomba showcased my technical expertise and collaborative skills.
