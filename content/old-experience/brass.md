At Brass, I lead the frontend engineering team, focusing on building and maintaining web projects and products and a components library to enhance the development experience and ensure streamlined development process and consistent style and functionality across our solutions. This role involves ensuring code quality, optimization, and adherence to conventions, as well as scaling and upgrading the codebase. I collaborate with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to plan, design, and implement products, ensuring alignment with business objectives. As an engineering manager, I oversee and manage projects and teams, strategize project implementation, and prepare roadmaps aligned with business goals. I also manage budgets, conducted one-on-one sessions with direct reports, lead sprint planning meetings, and focused on continuous process improvement.
