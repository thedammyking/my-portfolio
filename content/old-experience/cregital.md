As a web developer intern at Cregital, I gained valuable experience working on projects for clients like Zenith Bank, David Wei, Uberchic Ville and more. I developed WordPress websites, demonstrating my ability to build functional and visually appealing sites. I also implemented unique solutions, such as an ovulation calculator plugin for a Discourse forum and an ATM locator plugin for Zenith Bank's website.
